# Build Integrations

There are 3 types of integrations available in Squadcast.

### [Alert Sources](build-integrations/alert-sources/)

We integrate with various monitoring, observability, log management & error tracking tools and we call them as Alert sources.

All these alert sources uses webhooks as the core mechanism to send data to Squadcast and you can refer the [Build Alertsources](build-integrations/alert-sources/) section for more details about building this type of integrations.

### [Webhook connectors](../webhook-connectors/)

Webhook connectors are proxy scripts which receives data from [Squadcast outgoing webhooks](../outgoing-webhooks/) and transforms the payload to the required format of the 3rd party system which we are integrating with.

For more information about creating webhook connectors, please refer the [Webhook connector documentation](../webhook-connectors/).
